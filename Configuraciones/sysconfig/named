# OPTIONS="whatever"     --  These additional options will be passed to named

#                            -chroot.service unit file.
#
# DISABLE_ZONE_CHECKING  --  By default, service file calls named-checkzone
#                            utility for every zone to ensure all zones are
#                            valid before named starts. If you set this option
#                            to 'yes' then service file doesn't perform those
#                            checks.
