# Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them. Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods. In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:
# * index(), to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and
# * count(), to get the number of times an element appears in a list.
#You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: areas.
#
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]
# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))
# Print out how often 14.5 appears in areas
print(areas.count(14.5))
