# In this chapter, we're going to dive into the world of baseball. Along the way, you'll get comfortable with the basics of numpy, a powerful package to do data science.
# A list baseball has already been defined in the Python script, representing the height of some baseball players in centimeters. Can you add some code here and there to create a numpy array from it?
#
# Create list baseball
baseball = [180, 215, 210, 210, 188, 176, 209, 200]
# Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np
# Create a numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)
# Print out type of np_baseball
print(type(np_baseball))
