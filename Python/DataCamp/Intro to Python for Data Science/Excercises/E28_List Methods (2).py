# Most list methods will change the list they're called on. Examples are:
# * append(), that adds an element to the list it is called on,
# * remove(), that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and
# * reverse(), that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.
#You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of the house: areas.
#
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]
# Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size
areas.append(24.5)
areas.append(15.45)
# Print out areas
print(areas)
# Reverse the orders of the elements in areas
areas.reverse()
# Print out areas
print(areas)
