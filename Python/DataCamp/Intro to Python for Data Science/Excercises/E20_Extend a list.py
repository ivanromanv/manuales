# Subsetting Python lists is a piece of cake. Take the code sample below, which creates a list x and then selects "b" from it. Remember that this is the second element, so it has index 1. You can also use negative indexing.
# x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
# x[1]
# x[-3] # same result!
# Remember the areas list from before, containing both strings and floats? Its definition is already in the script. Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?
#
# If you can change elements in a list, you sure want to be able to add elements to it, right? You can use the + operator:
# x = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
# y = x + ["e", "f"]
# You just won the lottery, awesome! You decide to build a poolhouse and a garage. Can you add the information to the areas list?
#
# Create the areas list and make some changes
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "chill zone", 20.0,
         "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 10.50]

# Add poolhouse data to areas, new list is areas_1
areas_1 = areas + ["poolhouse", 24.5]
# Add garage data to areas_1, new list is areas_2
areas_2 = areas_1 + ["garage", 15.45]
print(areas_2)
