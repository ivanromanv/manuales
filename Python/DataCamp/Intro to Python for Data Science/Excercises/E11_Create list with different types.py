# The code on the right is the start of a solution. For some of the areas, the name of the corresponding room is already placed in front. Pay attention here! "bathroom" is a string, while bathis a variable that represents the float 9.50 you specified earlier.
# area variables (in square meters)
#
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50
# Adapt list areas
areas = ["hallway",hall, "kitchen", kit, "living room", liv, "bedroom", bed, "bathroom", bath]
# Print areas
