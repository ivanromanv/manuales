# Remember how you calculated the Body Mass Index for all baseball players? numpy was able to perform all calculations element-wise (i.e. element by element). For 2D numpy arrays this isn't any different! You can combine matrices with single numbers, with vectors, and with other matrices.
# Execute the code below in the IPython shell and see if you understand:
# import numpy as np
# np_mat = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
# np_mat * 2
# np_mat + np.array([10, 10])
# np_mat + np_mat
# np_baseball is coded for you; it's again a 2D numpy array with 3 columns representing height, weight and age.
#
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists
#
# updated is available as 2D numpy array
# Import numpy package
import numpy as np
# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)
# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated
print(np_baseball + updated)
# Create numpy array: conversion
conversion = [0.0254, 0.453592, 1]
# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
product = np_baseball * conversion
# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(product)
