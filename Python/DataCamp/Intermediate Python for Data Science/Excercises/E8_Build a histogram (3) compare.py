# In the video, you saw population pyramids for the present day and for the future. Because we were using a histogram, it was very easy to make a comparison.
# Let's do a similar comparison. life_exp contains life expectancy data for different countries in 2007. You also have access to a second list now, life_exp1950, containing similar data for 1950. Can you make a histogram for both datasets?
# You'll again be making two plots. The plt.show() and plt.clf() commands to render everything nicely are already included. Also matplotlib.pyplot is imported for you, as plt.
#
# Histogram of life_exp, 15 bins
# life_exp y life_exp1950 contienen datos
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist(life_exp, bins=15)
# Show and clear plot
plt.show()
plt.clf()
# Histogram of life_exp1950, 15 bins
plt.hist(life_exp1950, bins=15)
# Show and clear plot again
plt.show()
plt.clf()
