# It's time to customize your own plot. This is the fun part, you will see your plot come to life!
# You're going to work on the scatter plot with world development data: GDP per capita on the x-axis (logarithmic scale), life expectancy on the y-axis. The code for this plot is available in the script.
# As a first step, let's add axis labels and a title to the plot. You can do this with the xlabel(), ylabel() and title() functions, available in matplotlib.pyplot. This sub-package is already imported as plt.
#
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Basic scatter plot, log scale
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)
plt.xscale('log') 
# Strings
xlab = 'GDP per Capita [in USD]'
ylab = 'Life Expectancy [in years]'
title = 'World Development in 2007'
# Add axis labels
plt.xlabel(xlab)
plt.ylabel(ylab)
# Add title
plt.title(title)
# After customizing, display the plot
plt.show()
